## Notes
- Why writing culture?
	- Saves people's time
	- Documents the process of decision making
		- Limits rework and makes onboarding teammembers so much faster
	- Forces people to define their ideas
	- Gives people who don't like to speak up in meetings the chance to outline points, ask questions, and bring up concerns 
- How to start a writing culture?
	- Goal isn't to get people to start writing - it's to get them to start reading.
	- Start making agendas
		- Nothing clearly defines whether a meeting is not clearly defined as having to write it down
		- Send these out before the meeting (with the meeting invitation preferably)
	- Ask for feedback on the agendas
		- This gives people the time to synthesize their thoughts and change the conversation before the meeting instead of during it
		- Might find that the meeting doesn't need to happen once everyone has read the agenda and put in their 2 cents
- Next level: documentation as the default
	- Once people are reading, it's time to get them to write
	- Asking people to expand ideas in writing and send internal memos is a great first step, but remember our ultimate goal is not for people to write, it's for people to read
	- So, make sure the reading experience is great - using a tool like Slab or Notion as ways of centralizing where people share and discover docs is essential. Google Docs and Dropbox paper will not cut it - they are not centralized hubs and the reading/writing experience is much worse
	- Keeping these tools organized can be a pain though - so prioritize one with a great Search tool - I think Slab does this much better than Notion.
- Let's talk about Slack
	- Slack is not writing
	- Basecamp's guides, "Writing solidifies, chat dissolves."
- When to have a meeting?
	- Conflict resolution
		- More intense the conversation, the more mediums of communciation are necessary
		- Social experience (hearing people's voices and seeing their faces)
- "The medium is the message"

## Outline
### Intro
- In the early days of the pandemic, I came across this Tweet:
	- "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
- However, over the past two years, I think we've seen how working remotely has changed only one thing: where work happens. It hasn't really changed cultures around how work happens.
- The same problems we were complaining about in terms of too many meetings and too many interruptions during work that its hard to find time for focused, deep work still persist. Meeting fatigue has just been replaced by an even worse plague: Zoom fatigue. And constant interruption has only gotten worse I feel with the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. 
- And as a staunch remote work advocate, this makes me really sad. Because I think people are getting the wrong idea about working remotely. When it's not a location problem, it's a behavior problem.

### Why are we meeting?
This is the fundamental question we often ignore before clicking "Send" on a calendar invite. 

Meetings are not the only medium of communication at our disposal 

### Minutes or it didn't happen.
- Write it down with action items
- Otherwise you'll cause yourself to be doing a bunch of rework 
- Some people might have different ideas about what was discussed and decided on during the meeting - minutes solve that.
