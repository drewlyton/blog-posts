## Notes
- Why writing culture?
	- Saves people's time
	- Documents the process of decision making
		- Limits rework and makes onboarding teammembers so much faster
	- Forces people to define their ideas
	- Gives people who don't like to speak up in meetings the chance to outline points, ask questions, and bring up concerns 
- How to start a writing culture?
	- Goal isn't to get people to start writing - it's to get them to start reading.
	- Start making agendas
		- Nothing clearly defines whether a meeting is not clearly defined as having to write it down
		- Send these out before the meeting (with the meeting invitation preferably)
	- Ask for feedback on the agendas
		- This gives people the time to synthesize their thoughts and change the conversation before the meeting instead of during it
		- Might find that the meeting doesn't need to happen once everyone has read the agenda and put in their 2 cents
- Next level: documentation as the default
	- Once people are reading, it's time to get them to write
	- Asking people to expand ideas in writing and send internal memos is a great first step, but remember our ultimate goal is not for people to write, it's for people to read
	- So, make sure the reading experience is great - using a tool like Slab or Notion as ways of centralizing where people share and discover docs is essential. Google Docs and Dropbox paper will not cut it - they are not centralized hubs and the reading/writing experience is much worse
	- Keeping these tools organized can be a pain though - so prioritize one with a great Search tool - I think Slab does this much better than Notion.
- Let's talk about Slack
	- Slack is not writing
	- Basecamp's guides, "Writing solidifies, chat dissolves."
- When to have a meeting?
	- Conflict resolution
