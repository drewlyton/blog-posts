## Notes
- Why writing culture?
	- Saves people's time
	- Documents the process of decision making
		- Limits rework and makes onboarding teammembers so much faster
	- Forces people to define their ideas
	- Gives people who don't like to speak up in meetings the chance to outline points, ask questions, and bring up concerns 
- How to start a writing culture?
	- Goal isn't to get people to start writing - it's to get them to start reading.
	- Start making agendas
		- Nothing clearly defines whether a meeting is not clearly defined as having to write it down
		- Send these out before the meeting (with the meeting invitation preferably)
	- Ask for feedback on the agendas
		- This gives people the time to synthesize their thoughts and change the conversation before the meeting instead of during it
		- Might find that the meeting doesn't need to happen once everyone has read the agenda and put in their 2 cents
- Next level: documentation as the default
	- Once people are reading, it's time to get them to write
	- Asking people to expand ideas in writing and send internal memos is a great first step, but remember our ultimate goal is not for people to write, it's for people to read
	- So, make sure the reading experience is great - using a tool like Slab or Notion as ways of centralizing where people share and discover docs is essential. Google Docs and Dropbox paper will not cut it - they are not centralized hubs and the reading/writing experience is much worse
	- Keeping these tools organized can be a pain though - so prioritize one with a great Search tool - I think Slab does this much better than Notion.
- Let's talk about Slack
	- Slack is not writing
	- Basecamp's guides, "Writing solidifies, chat dissolves."
- When to have a meeting?
	- Conflict resolution
		- More intense the conversation, the more mediums of communciation are necessary
		- Social experience (hearing people's voices and seeing their faces)
- "The medium is the message"

## Outline
In the early days of the pandemic, as companies began shifting to remote work, I came across a Tweet that said:

> "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
> - Some Tweeter

But over the past two years, I don't think that we've actually answered that question. Because for many companies, shifting to remote work has changed only one thing: *where* work happens. *How* work happens has remained largely the same.

"Meeting fatigue" is now called "Zoom fatigue". The feelings of constant interruption and overwhelm once attributed to email have been amplified by the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. And the noise of office chatter that once made it impossible to focus is now *missed* as work happens in siloes that break down team cohesion and alignment.

It's clear by now that the persistent pull towards distraction and disorder in our organizations will not be solved by a change in scenery. We need to admit that these systemic issues are not caused by location or tooling - they are caused by our ineffective and inefficient cultures of communication.

And I believe that there is one core behavior that solves a majority of communication issues inside organizations: ***writing***. So, in this post, I'm going to share some writing practices I use to try and keep myself and my teams sane at work.

## Part 1: Meeting
- Beat the dead horse: too many meetings.
	- ***Why are we meeting?*** This is the fundamental question we often ignore before clicking "Send" on a calendar invite.
	- Trigger finger is too hot
	- They're not just annoying, they're our slowest and most expensive way to communicate as an organization.
	- An hour long meeting is not just 1 hour - it's the time of the meeting x the amount of people in the meeting + (the time people spent being blocked before the meeting was scheduled to happen x the amount of people blocked). 
	- We should be optimizing for the least amount of meetings as possible, but where that can't happen, we need to make our meeting time hyper efficient
- Script the meeting
	- 3 act structure
		- The Setup
			- Present
			- Purpose
			- Intended Results
		- The Conflict
			- Notes
			- Should be worthy of a meeting
			- Actual interpersonal conflict should always be done in a meeting.
		- The Resolution
			- Action items 
- Minutes or it didn't happen
	- Write it down with action items
	- Otherwise you'll cause yourself to be doing a bunch of rework 
	- Some people might have different ideas about what was discussed and decided on during the meeting - minutes solve that.

## Part 2: Messaging
- Communicate don't converse
	- Back and forth messaging of:
		- Hey, I've got a problem
		- What is it
		- Brief, not contextual description
		- Did you try this?
		- Yes
		- Did you try this?
		- Yes
		- Hmmm...let's schedule a meeting about it. Are you free tomorrow morning?
			- Player 1 has lost hours of life/work waiting for that meeting to get unblocked.
			- Player 2 has very little context going into the meeting about the problem
- Game changes with writeups
	- Player 1 writes down everything that's been going on, what they've tried, and what they suspect the issue to be
		- Sometimes this solves Player 1's problem through the "rubber ducky" effect
	- Player 2 receieves this an has a ton of context to provide in depth next steps for things to try if needed (that they can provide async)
	- If they do meet, it's a much more productive meeting with a tangible outcome

## Part 3: Meshing
- Documents as the source of truth
- Keeps everyone aligned
- Allows people to put out their thoughts and ideas in long form before pitching them to the rest of the group



## Conclusion
Writing cultures are ones that enable people to be in sync while being async. They enable people to have long periods of deep work that allow them to really work through problems and get things done. They enable people to close their laptops early because they're ahead of schedule and get time back for themselves.
