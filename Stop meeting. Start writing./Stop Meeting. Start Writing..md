I believe meetings, when done with purpose, carry an incredibe amount of value. Real-time collaboration is a great tool for shaping early-stage ideas, and being able to laugh together does wonders for building social bonds.

However, meetings are the most expensive medium of communication in our organizations - and our trigger finger for firing new calendar invites is probably too hot. So, in this post, I'm going to share the single strategy I use with my teams to have **less frequent, more intentional, more productive meetings.**

## The true cost of scheduled time.
How much does a an hour long meeting cost? The conventional management calculation is the duration of the meeting multiplied by how many people are in the meeting:
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people $$
So, a one hour meeting with 5 attendees costs 5 hours of time. However, this function only calculates the cost of the meeting itself. It doesn't take into account the large amount of unproductive time the meeting creates outside its block on the calendar.

A one hour meeting makes the three hour period that surrounds it essentially unusable for deep, focused, work. Work like that requires at least a two hour period of uninterrupted time. So, this means our one hour meeting also has an exceptionally high opportunity cost multiple for the rest of the hours in an individual's day.
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people * opportunity\_cost\_multiple $$
And in the case where a meeting is being held to fix an issue or reach an actionable decision, there is a cost to the time that person or project stays blocked while we wait for the calendar to tick down until the scheduled meeting time.

Factoring this in, our final equation for the cost of a meeting looks like this:
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people * opportunity\_cost\_multiple + (blocked\_time * people\_blocked)$$

And this equation doesn't even factor in if a meeting is pointless, purposeless, and provides no organizational value. All this to say that **meetings are an extremely risky variable expense.** An hour long meeting could cost the organization exponentially more time than its duration.

So, how can we mitigate the cost of meetings and reduce the risk of them costing more than they are worth? 

## My template for meaningful meetings.
Purposeful meetings are powerful, purposeless meetings are poison. To ensure meetings are always created with a strict, well defined objective, I recommend filling out three prompts with each meeting invite: *Purpose*, *Participants* and *Intended Results*.

### Purpose
A meeting's ***Purpose*** is a statement that justifies its existence. A great purpose statement answers a single core question: *Why does this conversation need to be a meeting?* A few things happen when you start taking the time to answer this question.

The first is that you have fewer, more intentional meetings with fewer, more intentional participants. When you have to justify a meeting's existence every time you click "Invite", you start to notice how hot your trigger finger is. This new friction grants you time to **question the medium**.

Meetings are not our only form of communication. Writeups, threaded conversations, and yes, email are sometimes much more effective tools for disseminating information. The purpose statement forces you to ask, "*Is there a better/faster/clearer way to communicate this?*"

### Participants
A meeting's ***Participants*** is pretty straight forward - the people requested to join the meeting. There is nothing special in this section, and it is somewhat optional. The goal here is just to create friction and pose the question, "*Who do we really need at this meeting?*"

This section has a great benefit of eliminating the obligation to invite everyone on a team to every meeting for "visibility". The host can invite the whole team for visibilty, but specify in the *Participants* section who should actually come. This solves the "Too many cooks" problem many meetings run into.

See the next section "Minutes or it didn't happen" for more context on how you can remove people from meetings without losing "visibility".

### Intended Results
A meeting's ***Intended Results*** are the specific, tangible, actionable goals that the meeting is designed to accomplish. This micro-agenda is essentially the task list for the meeting. It primes all participants to focus on the items at hand.

Great intended results start with solution oriented verbs like "fix", "decide", or "create". Words like "discuss" and "sync" do not imply a direct outcome and should be avoided at all costs. Idea generation and knowledge sharing are better served by asynchronous forms of communication.

In my experience, there should be no more than three intended results per meeting. And ideally, there is only one. Specifying meeting activity also allows the host better judge how long the meeting should be. 

We have a tendency as a society to schedule meetings in increments of 30 minutes. That is far too much time for a meeting with only one item to cover. Meetings expand to the time allotted. So, my rule of thumb is to schedule meetings with 15 minutes per intended result.

45 minutes to cover three big questions might seem like too little time, but you'd be suprised how people operate when a meeting has clear, time bound objectives. Individuals communicate more clearly, groups shut down meandering, off-topic discussions, and everyone focuses on the work.

### Examples
Lets look at a few examples of Purpose and Intended Results in action.

#### Scenario 1: Having an early conversation about a new feature
> **Purpose**
> Get together to talk through ideas for the new Notifications feature.
> 
> **Intended Results**
> 1. Discuss the concept
> 2. Get feedback from the team

❌ Purpose is vague and doesn't justify its existence as a meeting vs another form of communication. Pitches should almost always be writeups.
❌ "Discuss" is a verb without a direct outcome
❌ Feedback on work should almost always be given asynchronously and close to or within the tool used to do the work

> **Purpose**
> Quickly iterate together and spitball ideas for the potential Notifications feature.
> 
> **Participants**
> Just me and Keith so we can move quicker - we can send out minutes to the whole team afterwards.
> 
> **Intended Results**
> 1. Create an initial breadboard diagram that sketches out the affordances and gives us the confidence to move on to fat-marker sketching.

✅ Purpose has a clear need for synchronous communication ("quickly iterate").
✅ Clearly defines and reasons the participants.
✅ Contains a specific, clear, solution-oriented Intended Result.

#### Scenario 2: A weekly one-on-one
> **Purpose**
> Chat about what's been going on this week.
> 
> **Intended Results**

❌ Purpose is vague and doesn't justify the meeting's existence
❌ No specific intended results

> **Purpose**
> Openly discuss personal and professional issues, problems, or concerns Drew has as well as give feedback on Drew's professional development and performance at the company.
> 
> **Intended Results**
> 1. Update professional goals doc
> 2. Make a plan to mitigate or bubble-up any issues

✅ All personal and professional feedback should be delivered and documented in-person.
✅ Contains ritual Intended Results - good for creating habits and systems to document these types of discussions.

## Docs - not agendas.
A meeting's meaning is measured by its outcome - not its invite. So, once the participants get in the room, its time to do the hard part: **stay on task**. 

### Stick to the script.


### Take notes.
One of the strengths of verbal communication is its speed - most people can talk *much faster* than they can write. However, the spoken word is also the forgotten one. 

## Minutes or it didn't happen.
