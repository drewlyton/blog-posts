## Outline
In the early days of the pandemic, as companies began shifting to remote work, I came across a Tweet that said:

> "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
> - Some Tweeter

But over the past two years, I don't think that we've actually answered that question. Because for many companies, shifting to remote work has changed only one thing: *where* work happens. *How* work happens has remained largely the same.

"Meeting fatigue" is now called "Zoom fatigue". The feelings of constant interruption and overwhelm once attributed to email have been amplified by the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. And the noise of office chatter that once made it impossible to focus is now *missed* as work happens in siloes that break down team cohesion and alignment.

It's clear by now that the persistent pull towards distraction and disorder in our organizations will not be solved by a change in scenery. We need to admit that these systemic issues are not caused by location or tooling - they are caused by our ineffective and inefficient cultures of communication.

And I believe that there is one core behavior that solves a majority of communication issues inside organizations: ***writing***. So, in this post, I'm going to share some writing practices I use to try and keep myself and my teams sane at work.

## Part 1: Meeting
- Beat the dead horse: too many meetings.
	- ***Why are we meeting?*** This is the fundamental question we often ignore before clicking "Send" on a calendar invite.
	- Trigger finger is too hot
	- They're not just annoying, they're our slowest and most expensive way to communicate as an organization.
	- An hour long meeting is not just 1 hour - it's the time of the meeting x the amount of people in the meeting + (the time people spent being blocked before the meeting was scheduled to happen x the amount of people blocked). 
	- We should be optimizing for the least amount of meetings as possible, but where that can't happen, we need to make our meeting time hyper efficient
- Script the meeting
	- 3 act structure
		- The Setup
			- Present
			- Purpose
			- Intended Results
		- The Conflict
			- Notes
			- Should be worthy of a meeting
			- Actual interpersonal conflict should always be done in a meeting.
		- The Resolution
			- Action items 
- Minutes or it didn't happen
	- Write it down with action items
	- Otherwise you'll cause yourself to be doing a bunch of rework 
	- Some people might have different ideas about what was discussed and decided on during the meeting - minutes solve that.

## Part 2: Messaging
- Communicate don't converse
	- Back and forth messaging of:
		- Hey, I've got a problem
		- What is it
		- Brief, not contextual description
		- Did you try this?
		- Yes
		- Did you try this?
		- Yes
		- Hmmm...let's schedule a meeting about it. Are you free tomorrow morning?
			- Player 1 has lost hours of life/work waiting for that meeting to get unblocked.
			- Player 2 has very little context going into the meeting about the problem
- Game changes with writeups
	- Player 1 writes down everything that's been going on, what they've tried, and what they suspect the issue to be
		- Sometimes this solves Player 1's problem through the "rubber ducky" effect
	- Player 2 receieves this an has a ton of context to provide in depth next steps for things to try if needed (that they can provide async)
	- If they do meet, it's a much more productive meeting with a tangible outcome

## Part 3: Meshing
- Documents as the source of truth
- Keeps everyone aligned
- Allows people to put out their thoughts and ideas in long form before pitching them to the rest of the group



## Conclusion
Writing cultures are ones that enable people to be in sync while being async. They enable people to have long periods of deep work that allow them to really work through problems and get things done. They enable people to close their laptops early because they're ahead of schedule and get time back for themselves.
