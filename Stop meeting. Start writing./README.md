In the early days of the pandemic, as companies began shifting to remote work, I came across a Tweet that said:

> "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
> - Some Tweeter

But over the past two years, I don't think that we've actually answered that question. Because for many companies, shifting to remote work has changed only one thing: *where* work happens. *How* work happens has remained largely the same.

"Meeting fatigue" is now called "Zoom fatigue". The feelings of constant interruption and overwhelm once attributed to email have been amplified by the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. And the noise of office chatter that once made it impossible to focus is now *missed* as work happens in siloes that break down team cohesion and alignment.

It's clear by now that the persistent pull towards distraction and disorder in our organizations will not be solved by a change in scenery. We need to admit that these systemic issues are not caused by location or tooling - they are caused by our ineffective and inefficient cultures of communication.

And I believe that there is one core behavior that solves a majority of communication issues inside organizations: ***writing***. So, in this post, I'm going to share some writing practices I use to try and keep myself and my teams sane at work.

## Part I: Meeting
I am not someone who believes that all meetings are pointless.

Purposeful meetings are powerful, purposeless meetings are poison.
