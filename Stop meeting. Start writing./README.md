In the early days of the pandemic, as companies began shifting to remote work, I came across a Tweet that said:

> "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
> - Some Tweeter

But over the past two years, I don't think that we've actually answered that question. Because for many companies, shifting to remote work has changed only one thing: *where* work happens. *How* work happens has remained largely the same.

"Meeting fatigue" is now called "Zoom fatigue". The feelings of constant interruption and overwhelm once attributed to email have been amplified by the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. And the noise of office chatter that once made it impossible to focus is now *missed* as work happens in siloes that break down team cohesion and alignment.

It's clear by now that the persistent pull towards distraction and disorder in our organizations will not be solved by a change in scenery. We need to admit that these systemic issues are not caused by location or tooling - they are caused by our ineffective and inefficient cultures of communication.

And I believe that there is one core behavior that solves a majority of communication issues inside organizations: ***writing***. So, in this post, I'm going to share some writing practices that can help you quell the chaos of communicating at work.

## Part I: Meeting
I believe meetings, when done with purpose, carry an incredibe amount of value. Real-time collaboration is vital for shaping early-stage ideas, and being able to laugh together does wonders for building social bonds. However, meetings are also the slowest and most expensive medium of communication in our organizations - and our trigger finger firing off calendar invites is probably too hot.

### The True Cost of Scheduled Time
How long is an hour long meeting? Spoiler alert ðŸš¨ - not an hour. The conventional management calculation for the cost of a meeting is the duration of the meeting multiplied by how many people are in the meeting:
$$ meeting\_cost = duration * people $$
So, a one hour meeting with 5 attendees costs 5 hours of time. However, this function only calculates the cost of *active* meeting time. It doesn't take into account the large amount of *idle* time the meeting creates.



because it doesn't factor in the cost associated with the delay in work that is dependent on the outcome of the meeting.

The true cost 
$$ meeting\_cost = (duration * people) + (blocked\_people * duration\_blocked\_by\_outcome) $$

The cost of an hour long meeting is not just an hour of time - it's 

### Meet with Purpose



Our trigger fingers for firing off new calendar invites are too hot. So, we need to find systems that slow down the ability 



Purposeful meetings are powerful, purposeless meetings are poison.
