In the early days of the pandemic, as companies began shifting to remote work, I came across a Tweet that said:

> "I guess now we'll see how many meetings could have been an email"
> - Some Tweeter

But over the past two years, I don't think that we've actually answered that question. Because for many companies, shifting to remote work has changed only one thing: *where* work happens. *How* work happens has remained largely the same.

"Meeting fatigue" is now called "Zoom fatigue". The feelings of constant interruption and overwhelm once attributed to email have been amplified by the adoption of always-on, synchronous messaging services like Slack. And the noise of office chatter that once made it impossible to focus is now *missed* as work happens in siloes that break down team cohesion and alignment.

It's clear by now that the persistent pull towards distraction and disorder in our organizations will not be solved by a change in scenery. We need to admit that these systemic issues are not caused by location or tooling - they are caused by our ineffective and inefficient cultures of communication.

And I believe that there is one core behavior that solves a majority of communication issues inside organizations: ***writing***. So, in this post, I'm going to share some writing practices that can help you quell the chaos of communicating at work.

## Part I: Meeting
I believe meetings, when done with purpose, carry an incredibe amount of value. Real-time collaboration is a great tool for shaping early-stage ideas, and being able to laugh together does wonders for building social bonds. However, meetings are the most expensive medium of communication in our organizations - and our trigger finger that fires off new calendar invites is probably too hot.

### The true cost of scheduled time.
How much does a an hour long meeting cost? The conventional management calculation is the duration of the meeting multiplied by how many people are in the meeting:
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people $$
So, a one hour meeting with 5 attendees costs 5 hours of time. However, this function only calculates the cost of the meeting itself. It doesn't take into account the large amount of unproductive time the meeting creates outside its block on the calendar.

A one hour meeting makes the three hour period that surrounds it essentially unusable for deep, focused, work. Work like that requires at least a two hour period of uninterrupted time. So, this means our one hour meeting also has an exceptionally high opportunity cost multiple for the rest of the hours in an individual's day.
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people * opportunity\_cost\_multiple $$
And in the case where a meeting is being held to fix an issue or reach an actionable decision, there is a cost to the time that person or project stays blocked while we wait for the calendar to tick down until the scheduled meeting time.

Factoring this in, our final equation for the cost of a meeting looks like this:
$$ meeting\_cost = time * people * opportunity\_cost\_multiple + (blocked\_time * people\_blocked)$$

And this equation doesn't even factor in if a meeting is pointless, purposeless, and provides no organizational value. All this to say that **meetings are an extremely risky variable expense.** An hour long meeting could cost the organization exponentially more time than its duration.

So, how can we use writing to mitigate the cost of meetings and reduce the risk of them costing more than they are worth? 

### Purpose & Intended Results.
Purposeful meetings are powerful, purposeless meetings are poison. 

### Script the conversation.


### Minutes or it didn't happen.
