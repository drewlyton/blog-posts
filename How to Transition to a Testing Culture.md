- Testing is hard, but incredibly important
- Gives you confidence to:
	- Scale your team
	- Ship faster / more often
	- Know that what you're building hits the feature requirements
- So why do so many startups not write tests?
	- Usually a team of 2 engineers
	- It feels slower
	- Requirements change so often as the product is iterated on that writing tests feels like a recipe for a refactoring disaster
- These things are all true, but the decision to not write *any* tests creates a new problem if you end up getting out of the trough of sorrow
	- You don't have a testing culture
	- So you're scaling your team and shipping faster without knowing whether or not the code works or if it's hitting the requirements. You have no confidence because you didn't create a culture around testing.
- Well, then how do you transition to a testing culture?
- Two aspects:
	- Encourage
	- Automate
