One of my favorite books on software engineering is (of course) *The Pragmatic Programmer*\* by [Andrew Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author) "Andy Hunt (author)") and [David Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer) "Dave Thomas (programmer)"). First published in 1999, this book is a timeless classic that I can't recommend enough.

Among the many nuggets of wisdom

\*Thanks goes to Keith Stolte for giving me this book for Christmas.
