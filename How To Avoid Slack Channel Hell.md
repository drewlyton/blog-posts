**From convo with Ben**
I highly recommend having project channels denoted with `proj-` or another prefix. Also, having `sprint-${#}` can be helpful for scrum updates. Channel can be archived and a new one created so it's much easier to find all scrum updates for a given sprint in the future. `scrum` then becomes a channel to log conversations about the actual process.

I've heard a lot of people here have Slack fatigue - that usually happens because of a lack of guidance around _how_ channels are used and organization around _who_ needs to be in what channel. This could be a good time to revisit those questions (edited)
