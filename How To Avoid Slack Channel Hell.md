**From convo with Ben**
I highly recommend having project channels denoted with `proj-` or another prefix. Also, having `sprint-${#}` can be helpful for scrum updates. Channel can be archived and a new one created so it's much easier to find all scrum updates for a given sprint in the future. `scrum` then becomes a channel to log conversations about the actual process.

I've heard a lot of people here have Slack fatigue - that usually happens because of a lack of guidance around _how_ channels are used and organization around _who_ needs to be in what channel. This could be a good time to revisit those questions (edited)

What's the point of slack channels
- Written documentation of communication
- Means they should be designed to be archived
- Think about them as threads, not chat rooms
	- It's a replacement for email - you wouldn't have a 200 message email thread (and if you do god help you)
	- Channel is the subject - get goal oriented
		- When writing the description think:
			1. What's the subject?
			2. What's the condition for archival

Thoughts on organizing by project
- If you organize by project and feel like you have a bunch of slack channels, it probably means you have too many projects and need to cut down stuff
- Doing by project means that you can add people to the channel over time and they gain context of the conversation (can't do that if it's not one conversation, but a bunch)
	- At ST projects started with designer and product owner and moved on from there
	- Added engineers when we needed to
	- All links, convos, relevant info was all there
- Can have big projects that get shed into smaller projects
	- Talk big scope for new feature in a channel, then make separate project channels as those get spun up with the relevant parties so they can have more direct conversations
	- Then those conversations can get bubbled back up to the big group if need be, people can hop in and join solve the issue, and then leave again
	- Recommend no more than 3 layers and don't add all 3 if you don't need to, expand the channel over time and only break it up if conversation is off-topic or getting hyper specific (monitor the muted)
		- If most people are muted, it means the channel is to chatty
		- All team/domain specific (All team)
			- Big projects (ICs, PMs, Management if need be)
				- Small projects (ICs)
