# Blog Posts
This repository houses all of my documents, images, and notes pertaining to my blog posts for [drewis.cool](drewis.cool). They are all written in markdown for easy portability.

My `.md` editor of choice these days is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). It's a great app, and there's a plugin by [@denolehov](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) that makes it auto-sync with a git repository (like this one).
