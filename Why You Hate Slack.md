Are you feeling overwhelmed by Slack? Do you spend your work day constantly distracted by a barrage of notifications? Do you have nightmares where all you hear is that *tat-tat-tat* sound of a new message scrolling across your screen?

Well, you're most likely suffering from *Slack Fatigue*. And you're not alone - according to [this New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/slack-is-the-right-tool-for-the-wrong-way-to-work), employees are interrupted by Slack notifications once **every five minutes**. No wonder we fell like we can't get work done at work.

Slack, when left unmanaged, can be a huge deterrent to our team's overall efficiency. However, the pain Slack presents is not new. It is merely the symptom of poor communications practices that have plagued knowledge workers for decades.

In fact, we've seen Slack fatigue before - it was just called...

## Email overload.
Back in the 90s and early 2000s, email was the hot new medium for transferring information. It was designed to be a replacement for much slower and more ephemeral technologies like fax machines, voicemails, and sticky notes. But email made asynchronous, subject based messaging almost *too* fast, easy and cheap. 

By the late 2000s, people were overwhelmed with email. And with the first Blackberries and early smart phones coming onto the scene, this never-ceasing swath of messages became inescapable. By 2010, [it was reported](https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/tech-stress-emails-handle-day/story?id=11201183) that 38% of knowledge workers were experiencing some kind of "email overload".

[Joanne Cantor](https://yourmindonmedia.com/) - previously the director at the Center for Communication Research at University of Wisconsin–Madison - said of email at that time:

> "All of this new technology, which gives us wonderful advantages...comes with real challenges...When you're constantly being interrupted, your brain is not operating at its full capacity." 

This is exactly the same sentiment people are espousing about Slack today. Slack was designed to solve problems of email, but actually seems to have made them *worse*. For centuries, we've been obsessed with the *speed* that information can travel. But it feels like Osmo Wiio was right when he said,

> The more we communicate, the faster misunderstandings propagate.

Marshall McLuhann's theory, "The Medium is the Message", asks us to examine how the ways we transfer information change our society and even **rewire the ways that we think**.

So, with that in mind, let's think critically for a second about how our organizations change when...

## The medium is the (instant) message.
Real-time, always-on communications tools are great for fostering social cultures and creating a sense of belonging - even across great distances. There is no way I'd be as in-touch with my friends without group-chat apps like Messenger. 

However, when used as our primary means of sending and storing knowledge, these tools create dramatically negative consequences to our organizational communication.

For example, tools like Slack force us to be...

### Constrained by conversation.
Let's think about how the design of the message composer in an app like Slack changes the ways we share information:

![[Screen Shot 2022-09-12 at 1.32.13 PM.png]]

Notice how the text box is small and displays space for only a single line of text. This enourages us to send short, one line messages to the coconspirators in our channels.

Now, I appreciate striving to be succinct and brief. But I'd argue that it's nearly *impossible* to craft a message about a complex issue that provides clarity and context in 100 characters. This perceived constraint combined with *how easy* it is to click "Send" creates an optimization for speed and speed alone.

Sharing is fast, but the medium makes *what* is shared shallow and short-sighted. And if we think of our organizations constitutively - as a product of what and how we communicate - that means we're fostering **organizations that operate one line at a time.**

And although those lines are "in order"...

### In order becomes disorder in no time.
Imagine if your local library organized books solely by the date they were published. It would be extremely difficult for you to find all of the books related to a single subject, right? And even if you could search books by subject, it would still take you a long time to comb through each individual result to find and collect all the books about "dinosaurs".

Well, now imagine that the library also *removed the bindings* off of the books and stacked the *individual pages* together on the shelves - leaving you with no way of visualizing where one book began and the other ended. And now your search query returns all of the pages in the entire library that contain the word "dinosaurs".

**That's what Slack is like.** It is the worst library in the world.

The medium is organized around what's current. Channels are containers for conversations, and each channel is a linear series of messages with the latest 5-7 displayed on screen. It's impossible to discern where one conversation begins and another ends.

The content of each individual message is also almost always disconnected from its context. This makes search completely unreliable. There is no confidence that all of the messages *relevant* to the query are returned - only that the messages *containing* the query are.

That means information is certainly lost and falls through the cracks. There is no single source of truth which means there is *no shared reality*. This causes team misalignment, knowledge silos, slow onboarding, and a dependence on individual memory over institutional memory.

I will say, the problem of knowledge management is far worse with email due to the fact that emails are an "Invite to inform" system instead of a system like Slack which is "Informed by default". However, that does present further challenges with the medium of instant messaging.

With Slack we're...

### Always on and always behind.
Instant messaging demands that our attention be on *the instant*. The *tat-tat-tat* across our screens screams, *"Look at this right now!"*. A lot has been written about the mental fatigue this constant state of distraction creates. However, the **ASAP culture** that follows these behaviors presents equally deceptive dangers.

[[Patrick Lencioni]] - the author of *[[The Five Dysfunctions of a Team]]* - said, "If everything is important, than nothing is". And yet, no matter the urgency of their content, all messages in this medium come in with the same level of priority. And each one of them demands immediate resolution because if it ends up being pushed off screen, it is more than likely to be forgotten, lost or never read at all.

Rather than questioning the validity of its design, we adapt our behavior to meet the medium. We keep our chats always on in the background. As a new message comes in, we treat them like an instant priority and send quick, off-the-cuff replies rather than slowing down and taking the time to strategize. We make sometimes careless decisions just so that we can get back to the task at hand.

Now, of course, we could opt-out - turn it off. But then, we risk missing out on something that's *actually* of importance or risk not having a say - because Slack is "where work happens". It's an incredibly ironic paradox.

Communications technologies like Slack **encourage us to always think fast**. But [[Daniel Kahneman]]'s book *[[Thinking Fast and Slow]]* talks about how that is a sure-fire way to make consistent, repeated, avoidable mistakes. Mistakes that could end up being detremental to us, our organizations, and our customers.

We can't run our organization or live our lives always on edge. We need time to breathe, think deeply, take stock of all the information at our disposal, and then come to a fully informed decision. This quote by Kahneman says it all:

> Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it.

I know this section has probably felt like me just complaining about Slack, but that is not the point. This all to say that for great organizational communication...

### The solution isn't speed.
I think this line from Cal Newport's article *[[Slack Is The Right Tool For The Wrong Way To Work]]*  sums up the problems with synchronous messaging tools like Slack really well:

> The future of office work won’t be found in continuing to reduce the friction involved in messaging but, instead, in figuring out how to avoid the need to send so many messages in the first place.

So, how do we do that?

## Great communication is knowledge curation.
There is a place for instant messaging - but we can't just organize our slack channels better and have everything be fine. There are significant problems with the medium that make a mess of managing information.

People get obsessed with slack channel orgaxnization to solve this problem. Misses the actual point.

Managing information is a process of curated documentation. It's about constantly distilling what's new and connecting it to what's known so that it's discoverable and usable.

Discuss how writeups and memos are a much more efficient way of communicating information in context at the end of the day. Threaded feedback and conversation is better than email and IM (it's slow, long form, and stays in context).

Instant messaging should only be used for quick conversation and socialization.

## When and how to use Slack.
Sometimes, we don't get to pick the tools, we can only practice better processes.

### Chat it down - then write it up.
Document discussions and especially decisions in a separate app. Prevents important information from getting lost and helps people be on the same page when there is a page to be on.

### Think in threads.
Every message is either starting a new thread of replying to another. Helps keep conversations in context and makes then easier to reread.

### Organize to archive.
Point of slack is to document communication - to create points of reference that make it easy

Most teams set up Slack like a series of long-running group chats for teams. This is an extremely inefficient way of organizing group communication. Context is everything. Even with threads and replies, jumping back into a conversation that started 4 days ago takes a ton of context switching inside the channel - and it makes it much more likely for things to get disorganized and lost.

Instead, it's better to think about channels falling into one of these areas: Topics, Functions, Projects, and Alerts

#### 📖 Topics
Cross-team discussion that is not directly related to a functional area of the business. These are mutable.
- Continuous learning (TIL)
- General
- Social stuff

#### 🤝 Functions
Anyone can join and provide insight. To ask questions of others on the team/get feedback and help, etc.
- Design
- Engineering
- Product
- HR

#### 🛠 Projects
- Sprints
- Projects
- Clients

#### 📣 Alerts
Infrequent, targeted messaging to a group of people.
- Announcements
- Automated channels

## Conclusion
If you're really struggling to employ these, look into a tool that makes it easier for creating threaded, asynchronous discussions like [[Twist]].

## Random notes
Replacing email - a tool for asynchronous, subject based, messaging. But email was never designed to support the volume of communication that started happening inside companies. People's inbox's started to be overwhelmed, communication started falling through the cracks, and there was never a good solution to threaded conversation. Sound familiar?

Slack was born to solve these problems. It made messaging quicker, messages more discoverable, and notifications more direct. It's faster, real-time email.

The problem is that Slack is, at its core, an instant messaging tool - so that's how it's used. Organize it like a series of group chats - that's a bad idea and makes the problems it was designed to replace worse than email.

If you insist on using an instant messaging tool like Slack as a default way of communication, here are some helpful tips.




This speed has some benefits affects our businesses in dramaticly negative ways.

If we think about Marshall McLuhann's theory that, "the medium is the message" feels especially relevant here. 

Many of us think of communication as a process *within* our organizations. We think of it as something we do inside our companies as a separate process from our "actual work". However, our organizations are, in actuality, solely a product of communication.

[[Matthew Koschmann]], an organizational communication researcher at the University of Colorado Boulder.

Koschmann and others in the study of organizational communication believe in a constitutive or social constructive view of communication - where communication is actually the process by which we create our organizations.

Talk about [[Constitutive View of Communication]] and how organizations don't just practice communication, but are communication. Talk about how that connects to [[The Medium is the Message]] idea and how the ways we communicate actually rewire our brains.
