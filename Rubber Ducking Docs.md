One of my favorite books on software engineering is (of course) *The Pragmatic Programmer*\* by [Andrew Hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Hunt_(author) "Andy Hunt (author)") and [David Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(programmer) "Dave Thomas (programmer)"). First published in 1999, this book is a timeless classic that I can't recommend enough.

Among the many nuggets of wisdom in this wonderful read is ["rubber ducking"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging). This is a method of debugging that involves simply explaining the problem either verbally or in writing. Usually, by externally communicating the issue, an untested assumption is presented that leads to finding the solution.

## This shit really works.
Employing this tactic has helped me avoid banging my head against my computer for days on end countless times. The constant practice of explaining bugs and issues has also made me faster at triaging them. I'm calmer and more confident when fires pop up because it's easier to see patterns that link the current problem to another I've seen before. 

Rubber ducking has become such an important part of my practice as an engineer that I actually created what I call a *Rubber Ducking Doc*. This is a single page template with questions that prompt me through the process of communicating the issue at hand.

The doc looks something like this:

```markdown
# What's the problem?


# How do I reproduce the problem?


# Have I seen a similar problem before?


# Have others seen this problem before?


# Things to test


# Notes

```



\*Thanks goes to Keith Stolte for giving me this book for Christmas.
