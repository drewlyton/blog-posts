Don't use bullet points when taking notes.

Something I'm bad at. I default to creating long, unrully trees of bullets of all shape and size.

In reality the stream of conscious paragraph with sentences and line breaks for delineating changes in thought is easier to read and more organized - cause it doesn't give a sense of false organization.

Bullets are lists. If it's a list, use bullets. Otherwise, just keep writing.

Write blocks not bullets.
