## Notes
- Why writing culture?
	- Saves people's time
	- Forces people to define their ideas
	- Gives people who don't like to speak up in meetings the chance to outline points, ask questions, and bring up concerns 
- How to start a writing culture?
	- Start making agendas
		- Nothing clearly defines whether a meeting is not clearly defined as having to write it down
		- Send these out before the meeting (with the meeting invitation preferably)
	- Ask for feedback on the agendas
		- This gives people the time to synthesize their thoughts and change the conversation before the meeting instead of during it
		- Might find that the meeting doesn't need to happen once everyone has read the agenda and put in their 2 cents
