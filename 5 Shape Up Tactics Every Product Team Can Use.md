I try to steer clear of dogma. That's why I don't subscribe to any one method of developing products. Scrum, Lean, FDD, Kanban, Scrumban, XP, Spiral, etc. - they all have their strengths and weaknesses (yes, even *Waterfall*). There is no *right way* of organizing and developing product. 

I believe in learning many methodologies, trying out different ideas, and creating systems that work for the products I'm building and the teams I'm building them with.

*Shape Up* is a product development methodology that I think is well suited for this type of customization. Although it was developed at Basecamp - a company known for its dogmatic ways of working - most of the strategies they share in the book are malleable and portable.

At its core, *Shape Up* is really just a set of tactics designed to help teams focus on the most important aspect of product development: the relationship between problem and solution. So, in this post, I'm going to share five tools I find incredibly useful tools from Shape Up.

## 1. Breadboarding
Externalize the concept. Make it visual enough. Show the flow and the dependencies. Can do this for visual products as well as architectural ones. Sits at intersection of storyboarding, wire-framing, and flow diagram. I like it better than storyboarding because it lays out the affordances. I like it better than wire-framing because it's about how it works - not looks. I like it better than flow diagram because it's slightly higher fidelity.

## 2. Fat Marker Sketches
Design at the right level of fidelity. Don't get locked into a "look" or a strict flow.

## 3. The Pitch
Solve the problem before you write the code.

Can go look at the template yourself, things I want to call out:
1. Fixed time. Variable scope.
2. Rabbit Holes (problems created by the solution that should be thought through before implementation)

## 4. The Handoff 
Self organizing teams. Teams create the tasks, track them however they want, create scopes, and write reports of how each scope is coming along.

## 5. Cycles
Words matter.



**Quick note:** This post discusses the concepts I like using from the product development methodology described in *Shape Up*. It does not mean that I condone [the idiotic beliefs and behaviors](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion) of the Basecamp founders or the author, Ryan Singer. I wrote about my thoughts on that situation [here](https://join.lumastic.com/stories/social-impact).
