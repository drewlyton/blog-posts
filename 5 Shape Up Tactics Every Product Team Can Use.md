I try to steer clear of dogma. That's why I don't subscribe to any one method of developing products. Scrum, Lean, FDD, Kanban, Scrumban, XP, Spiral, etc. - they all have their strengths and weaknesses (yes, even *Waterfall*). There is no *right way* of organizing and developing product. 

I believe in learning many methodologies, trying out different ideas, and creating systems that work for the products I'm building and the teams I'm building them with.

*Shape Up* is a product development methodology that I think is well suited for this type of customization. Although it was developed at Basecamp - a company known for its dogmatic ways of working - most of the strategies they share in the book are malleable and portable.

At its core, *Shape Up* is really just a set of tactics designed to help teams focus on the most important aspect of product development: the relationship between problem and solution. So, in this post, I'm going to share five incredibly useful tools from Shape Up that any team can use.

## 1. Breadboarding


## 2. Fat Marker Sketches
Design

## 3. The Pitch


## 4. The Handoff 
Self organizing teams

## 5. Cycles
Words matter.



**Quick note:** This post discusses the concepts I like using from the product development methodology described in *Shape Up*. It does not mean that I condone [the idiotic beliefs and behaviors](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418208/basecamp-all-hands-meeting-employee-resignations-buyouts-implosion) of the Basecamp founders or the author, Ryan Singer. I wrote about my thoughts on that situation [here](https://join.lumastic.com/stories/social-impact).
